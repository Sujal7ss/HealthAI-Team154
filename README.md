## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 🧩 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **virtualenv** (for Python environments)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- **GPU** (recommended for running models like Whisper and LLMs)
  
  ### 📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sujal7ss/HealthAI-Team154.git
cd HealthAI-Team154
```

  ### 🔧 Step 2: Set Up the Backend
  
a. FastAPI (Python Backend)

```bash
cd backend/fastapi
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

b. Node.js Backend

```bash
cd ../node-backend
npm install
node index.js
```

This will start the Node.js server on the default port (usually http://localhost:3001).

  ### 💻 Step 3: Set Up the Frontend

```bash
cd ../../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the React frontend on http://localhost:3000.

  ### ✅ Step 4: Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the HealthAI application.

## 🧬 Model Architecture Overview

Our system integrates multiple AI models to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency:

### 1. **Speech Recognition & Translation**
- **Whisper**: Transcribes multilingual doctor-patient conversations into text.
- **NLLB (No Language Left Behind)**: Translates transcriptions into English, ensuring language inclusivity.

### 2. **Clinical NLP & Assessment**
- **GPT-4 / LLaMA (fine-tuned)**: Processes translated conversations to extract symptoms, suggest possible diagnoses, and highlight critical red flags.

### 3. **Diagnostic Image & Signal Interpretation**
- **CheXNet**: Analyzes chest X-rays to detect potential abnormalities.
- **Custom CNN Models**: Processes ECG data to identify irregularities and assist in cardiac assessments.

These models collectively provide a comprehensive diagnostic overview, aiding physicians in making informed decisions.
